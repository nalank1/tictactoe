Assignment 3: TicTacToe Game (PHP)
Students will enhance their TicTacToe game to have a PHP server component for managing the scoring by using AJAX to communicate between the HTML/CSS/JS client with the PHP server.

Objectives
You will enhance your single-player TicTacToe Game by adding a PHP server component to your TicTacToe GitHub code repository based on your models built during the labs.

You will expose the TicTacToe game functionality through a JSON API, and update your JavaScript to make AJAX calls to your newly created API.

All game state should be stored on the PHP server (you can store that information in the PHP $_SESSION) and your HTML/CSS/JavaScript should focus on displaying the current state of the game (the JavaScript should NOT calculate scores or track progress, just display the current state).

You will track a game leaderboard showing your top 10 scores. For simplicity, this information can also be stored in the PHP $_SESSION.

Deliverables
Consider keeping a copy of the original JS version (in /versions/v01) of the game before making changing for this assignment.

You will submit all code in your TicTacToe GitHub code repository. You will update your README.md to update how your game works and screenshots of the various user interface states.

You will be graded on the following criteria.

Mark	Description
10.0	HTML, CSS, JavaScript adaptation for server-side updates
10.0	Quality of PHP TicTacToe models
5.0	Managing game state in PHP API Server
5.0	Managing leaderboard in PHP API Server / models
